Steps to compile & run program:
1. Create a testing directory in Linux/WSL
2. Include dining.cpp into directory
3. Compile the program by using "g++ dining.cpp -o dining -pthread" (Make sure your system has the g++ compiler)
4. Run program by entering "./dining" into command line
5. Program will continue indefinitely, so terminate program when evaluation is done.
